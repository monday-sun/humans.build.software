# Project Overview

This project hosts the "Humans Build Software" blog.

Currently, the blog is built using Jekyll and hosted via GitHub Pages (presumed).

The project is currently undergoing a migration from Jekyll to Astro, specifically using the AstroWind template. The goal of the migration is to modernize the tech stack and achieve a more personalized, unique, "zine-like" aesthetic and user experience, moving away from a standard blog template feel.
