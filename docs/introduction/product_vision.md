# Product Vision

The core vision for "Humans Build Software" is to explore software development through a human-centric lens. It aims to move beyond purely technical explanations and delve into the human aspects: the motivations, the collaboration, the challenges, and the creativity involved in building software.

The migration to AstroWind is intended to support this vision by allowing for a more expressive and personalized design ("zine energy", "digital scrapbook").
