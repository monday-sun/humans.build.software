  <h1>Welcome to Humans Build Software</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to Humans Build Software, where I, Monday, share insights and
    experiences from my journey in software development. With a background in
    fixing tech debt and a passion for improving software construction, this
    blog is a platform for exploring how to improve development practices in a
    way that respects our brains' tendency to make mistakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    From Amazon to Tableau, Apple to Mode Analytics, I've worked with various
    engineers at different stages of developing their practices. I take pride in
    helping others turn "sounds good in theory" practices into a daily reality.
    Through this blog, I aim to create a community where we can learn from each
    other's experiences and grow as software professionals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're interested in development processes, refactoring, testing,
    wrangling tech debt, or want to dive into software construction, Humans
    Build Software has something for you. Join me as we navigate the software
    development challenges and discover the human side of coding.
