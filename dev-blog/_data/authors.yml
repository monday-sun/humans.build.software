  bio: "<p>I'm a seasoned software engineer specializing in refactoring and managing technical debt. Most recently, I served as a Staff Engineer at Mode Analytics, where I focused on upgrading and enhancing software practices, including the adoption of Feature Flags as a primary release flow, facilitated a cultural shift towards smaller, more frequent commits, and introduced contracts to take better advantage of Nx’s dependency graph.</p>
<p>My career has spanned over a decade in top tech companies like Tableau Software, Apple, and Amazon, where I've completed significant rewrite, refactoring, and re-architecture projects. My journey often leads me straight to the scariest parts of code, so I’ve developed strategies to facilitate improvements that can be built in at any stage of development.</p>
<p>My journey also included transitioning to non-binary several years into my career. At that time, I struggled with focus and memory, so I found ways to improve my processes to handle that. Today, I rely heavily on these changes and value the ways our process choices can help reduce the impact of making mistakes and make it feel safer to make them.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about improving software quality and developer experience, and I share my insights through articles and presentations. <i>Humans Build Software</i> is a space for me to create the resources I wish existed with my people-focused flair. When not coding, I enjoy fiber crafts, cooperative board games, video games, and rock climbing.</p>"
