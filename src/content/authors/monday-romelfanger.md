I’m a software engineer who’s spent over a decade working in the guts of complex systems at companies like Apple, Amazon, Tableau, and Mode Analytics. I specialize in refactoring scary legacy code, untangling technical debt, and building process improvements that make room for humans to do their best work—even when the tools (or the brains) are a little glitchy.

Over the years, I’ve led re-architecture efforts, shifted engineering cultures toward smaller, safer iterations, and helped teams embrace tools like Feature Flags, contract-based boundaries, and monorepo-aware builds using Nx. Most of my best work happens somewhere between “that file no one wants to open” and “the process nobody knows how to fix.”

Mid-career, I came out as non-binary and began navigating attention, memory, and executive function challenges. That forced me to reimagine my approach to development, and I’ve become deeply interested in workflows that reduce cognitive load, support mistake recovery, and treat humans like the variable they are—not a bug to fix.

Humans Build Software is where I write about building tech in a way that works for people, not just with them. It’s part blog, part lab, part therapy session with a build pipeline. When I’m not coding, I’m usually working on fiber crafts, playing co-op board games, or being supervised by my cats.
