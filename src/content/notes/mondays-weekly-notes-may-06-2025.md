_Weekly Notes are here to inspire others experimenting right now, give me a framework for reflection, and open up discussion around these workflows._

## Highlights

- Tried GitHub's new MCP integration in Cursor ‚Äî and it‚Äôs changing how I think about where planning lives.
- Published a new vision doc on human-AI collaboration that's now guiding multiple workstreams.
- Returned to Quilt with fresh energy, especially around memory structures and modular refactoring.
- Starting to think through how to automate parts of my refactor-first workflow.

## In-Progress / Work Notes

- **GitHub MCP in Cursor**

  - Finally got hands-on with GitHub‚Äôs MCP surface inside Cursor. It‚Äôs quickly becoming my favorite in-between space, structured, persistent, but not coupled directly to the code.
  - I'm experimenting with using it as a rule-based command center for dev planning. Still loose, but the potential is huge.

- **Vision Work: AI Collaboration**

  - Published [‚ÄúThe Future of Working with AI‚Äù](https://humans.build.software/blog/future-of-working-with-ai), which maps out a collaboration model for LLMs that centers memory, modularity, and intent.
  - The ideas from that post are now shaping my planning systems, agent design, and how I think about artifact generation.

- **Quilt**

  - Spent time this week reworking mental models around memory graphs and just-in-time assembly. GraphRAG helped me imagine what swatch chaining might look like dynamically.
  - Began outlining possible automation points in the refactor-first workflow ‚Äî I'm bored of asking cursor to do the same things over and over.

- **Blog + Publishing**
  - [‚ÄúRefactor-First, Feature-Last‚Äù](https://humans.build.software/blog/refactor-first-feature-last) is live and seems to be resonating. It‚Äôs a reflection on losing my rhythm in AI-assisted dev ‚Äî and regaining it through slow, intentional refactor work.
  - Missed last week‚Äôs notes, but this one feels like a solid re-entry.

## Reflection

- New planning surfaces like MCP are helping me shift out of ‚Äúcode or nothing‚Äù thinking. It‚Äôs giving ideas a place to live while they‚Äôre still forming.
- There‚Äôs real clarity in watching the vision doc loop back into practical work. It doesn‚Äôt feel theoretical anymore.
- Started going to the gym and having a great time with it!

## üí¨ Open Threads

- Mostly thinking on how I can use AI to create an automated refactor-first sort of workflow. Cursor really isn't hitting the way I'd like, and there's definitely something more to build here.
