On the left, a large orange tabby cat is lying with eyes closed, partially curled around a calico cat in the middle who is resting calmly with eyes half open. On the right, a smaller black-and-white cat is curled up tightly, sleeping. Behind them is a white pillow with a tropical leaf and flower pattern. The scene is peaceful and bathed in warm sunlight.'

_Weekly Notes are here to inspire others experimenting right now, give me a framework for reflection, and open up discussion around these workflows._

## Highlights

- Started shaping a new cadence for the week â€” theme blocks instead of strict scheduling.
- Built a rough iOS prototype to explore how my phone could support this rhythm.
- Rebuilt/branded the blog so it feels more 'me' and inviting

## In-Progress / Work Notes

- **Site & Blog**

  - Migrated everything to `humans.build.software`; much closer to how I want things to feel.
  - Wrote a new post this week and started thinking about a regular rhythm for educational writing, planning on one post and one notes each week.
  - Lost some functionality, like comments in the switch.

- **Detox and Restructuring**

  - After doing a lot, very quickly early in the week I noticed I was riding the 'oh, look how much I can do' high a little too hard
  - Took an LLM detox day on Wednesday, cross-stitched, hung out, got away from the computer
  - I decided to try coming up with a schedule that sets priority themes (e.g. Creative Work, Recharge, Social) for morning/afternoon/evening time blocks to help find more balance and give a reason to not deep dive for too long.

- **Time Block Focus (iOS App)**

  - Trying a little iphone prototype, built around the new week structure. Each day is broken into morning / afternoon / evening focus areas. Right now it puts whatever my current theme is on the app display
  - If I find it useful this week then might add Widget + Live Activity
  - Swift packages handled in Cursor; Xcode for UI wiring and device deployment.
  - Still annoying to wrangle the Apple dev stack, but I'm getting better at working around it.

- **Quilt**

  - Didn't touch code this week â€” paused while my head was in other systems.
  - Spent time this week messing with the memory back workflow, so it'll be interesting to pick this back up next week.

## Thinking & Reflection

- Even small rituals shift how I approach the week. The cadence system is helping, even if I'm still adapting to it.
- The "detox day" in the middle of the week (Wednesday) was key â€” space to not push anything forward.
- Energy levels are currently unpredictable -- stress and allergies are dragging me down. Having thematic focus will hopefully help me find more balance.
- LLMs don't work when I'm being distractable and not clearly explaining myself.

## Cursor Rules

- [collaboration.mdc](assets/files/2025-04-21/collaboration.mdc)
  - Trying a variant of this in my various workspaces with week as a replacement for memory bank.
  - The agents struggle to find context unless very explicitly told to read something, and even then they'll avoid it. I wonder if this is related to the way LLMs won't admit they don't know/aren't sure about something. Since it's based on human text, we don't ever demonstrate seeking knowledge, we have it. Kind of the premise of Quilt. How can the llm have the knowledge it needs?

## Links & Publishing

- âœ… New blog post live: [How LLMs 'Know' Stuff](https://humans.build.software/blog/how-llms-know-stuff)
- I have a few more ideas to do soon:
  - How small changes in context can have outsized impacts
  - A Context building workflow

---

## Life & Grounding

- Sunshine yoga in the morning helps reset my mood.
- Happy Easter!

## ðŸ’¬ Open Threads

- What tools support LLM + GitHub workflows without overwhelming the human?
- How do I make weekly cadence stick without turning it into yet another rule I resist?
- How can we reduce friction on providing LLMs with context?
