      <h1 class="mb-8 text-3xl font-bold">About Humans Build Software</h1>
      <p class="mb-4 max-w-3xl text-lg">
        I’m a software engineer who’s spent over a decade working in the guts of complex systems at companies like
        Apple, Amazon, Tableau, and Mode Analytics. I specialize in refactoring scary legacy code, untangling technical
        debt, and building process improvements that make room for humans to do their best work—even when the tools (or
        the brains) are a little glitchy.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 max-w-3xl text-lg">
        Over the years, I’ve led re-architecture efforts, shifted engineering cultures toward smaller, safer iterations,
        and helped teams embrace tools like Feature Flags, contract-based boundaries, and monorepo-aware builds using
        Nx. Most of my best work happens somewhere between “that file no one wants to open” and “the process nobody
        knows how to fix.”
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 max-w-3xl text-lg">
        Mid-career, I came out as non-binary and began navigating attention, memory, and executive function challenges.
        That forced me to reimagine my approach to development, and I’ve become deeply interested in workflows that
        reduce cognitive load, support mistake recovery, and treat humans like the variable they are—not a bug to fix.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 max-w-3xl text-lg">
        <em>Humans Build Software</em> is where I write about building tech in a way that works <em>for</em> people, not
        just with them. It’s part blog, part lab, part therapy session with a build pipeline. When I’m not coding, I’m usually
        working on fiber crafts, playing co-op board games, or being supervised by my cats.
